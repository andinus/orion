#+TITLE: Orion

Orion is a simple cli client to check for compromised passwords using Have I
Been Pwned API.

*Note*: Your password is not sent anywhere, only the first 5 characters of the
SHA-1 hash of the input is sent to HIBP API.

*Note*: Padding is currently not supported by Orion.

* Working
- Orion takes input from the user
- Input is hashed & split (prefix: [:5], suffix: [5:])
- Prefix is sent to the HIBP API
- HIBP API returns list of suffixes along with frequency
- Orion looks for suffix from the list of suffixes

Match means the password is present in HIBP database & has been compromised.
