* Working

- Password is hashed & split (prefix: [:5], suffix: [5:])
- Prefix is sent to the HIBP API
- HIBP API returns list of suffixes along with frequency
- Orion looks for suffix from the list of suffixes

Match means the password is present in HIBP database & has been compromised.

- *Note*: Password not present in database doesn't mean that it is a
  strong password.

* History

Orion v0.1.0 was a simple cli application that asked user for password &
returned the results. I never used this because I don't generate
password in head, ~pass~ is my password manager & it stores all my
passwords.

Orion was ported from Go to Raku.
