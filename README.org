* Working
- Password is hashed & split (prefix: [:5], suffix: [5:])
- Prefix is sent to the HIBP API
- HIBP API returns list of suffixes along with frequency
- Orion looks for suffix from the list of suffixes

Match means the password is present in HIBP database & has been compromised.

*Note*: Password not present in database doesn't mean that it is a strong
 password.
* History
Orion v0.1.0 was a simple cli application that asked user for password &
returned the results. I almost never used this because I don't generate password
in head, =pass= is my password manager & it stores all my passwords. So, the next
version will check all my passwords from password store & return the results.
